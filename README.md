# Rotating Navigation
A project based on the third project in Brad Traversy & Florin Pop's Udemy course, "50 Projects in 50 Days". The instructor's original code is available at https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days

For this project, I only watched the introduction video that showed what I'd build. I did not look at any of the instructor's code until I had completed the project.

It took me a while to figure out to use `display: grid;` on the rotating circle. Everything else fell into place pretty easily, though, and once it occurred to me to use grid, it seemed obvious.
